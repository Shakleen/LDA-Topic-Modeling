# LDA Topic Modeling

Originally, I was introduced to __Latent Dirichlet Distribution__ for topic modelling in **CS447 Natural Language Processing** course. I am taking the course as part of the **Master's of Data Science** program at the **University of Rochester**. Topic modeling useing LDA was the first assignment of the course. This is an extension of that assignment where I go deeper into experimenting with the gensim LDA model. I also dive into evaluation metrics like **perplexity** and **coherence score** to evaluate the LDA model.

This project is also my introduction to using **BlueHive**, the amazing cloud computing resource, provided by **CIRC** at the UoR. The project wouldn't have been possible without it.
